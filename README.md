# Angular2 Schema Form No Reduce

This is a forked project from [angular2-schema-form](https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular2-schema-form)

The only difference is:
* A form will send empty fields with an empty value.

Angular2 Schema Form is an Angular2 module allowing you to instanciate an HTML form from a [JSON schema](http://json-schema.org/).
